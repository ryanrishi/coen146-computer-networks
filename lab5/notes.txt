char is signed (-128 to 127)
so use unsigned char (0 - 255)

./randgenerator | head | entropy
./randgenerator | head > test (?)

we have to document more shit this time (even SO)

1. measures from 3 different file sizes (byte generator)
2. measures from 3 different sample files (esp. 3 different file types)
- think about digital files, which often use compression. a compressed filetype will have higher entropy
- keep file size consistent
3. discuss your results and how you generated your byte stream
